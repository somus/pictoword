# Pictoword

This is a silly game called Pictoword which I used to play in my mobile. I wanted to do
something with the unsplash api. So, I made a web version of the game using ReactJS and
Apollo. All pictures which are required for this game utilizes unsplash's [random API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo).

Server is located inside `./server` folder and it is powered by `prisma` and `grpahql-yoga`. Client is powered by `create-react-app` and `apollo-client`. UI is powered by `tachyons`.

### Getting started
To start the server,

```
cd server
yarn
yarn dev
```

To start the client,

```
yarn
yarn start
```
